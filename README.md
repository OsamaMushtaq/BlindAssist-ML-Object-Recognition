🦯 BlindAssist
Machine Learning Enhanced Object Recognition, GPS Tracking, and Speech Feedback

Final Year Project (FYP)
Lahore Garrison University
Batch: 2024

📌 Project Overview

With over 284 million people globally affected by visual impairment, independent navigation remains a critical challenge. Most existing assistive technologies lack real-time intelligence, environment awareness, and integrated safety features, leaving visually impaired individuals vulnerable in dynamic environments.

BlindAssist is a hardware–software integrated assistive system that combines machine learning–based object recognition, GPS-based navigation, and real-time speech feedback to enhance mobility, safety, and independence for visually impaired users.

❗ Problem Statement

Existing assistive technologies for visually impaired individuals often fail to provide real-time assistance and comprehensive functionality, limiting their effectiveness in dynamic environments.
This lack of intelligent feedback and navigation support increases the risk of accidents and dependency.

The BlindAssist project addresses this gap by integrating machine learning, GPS tracking, and speech feedback into a single smart system. The goal is to empower visually impaired individuals, improve accessibility, and promote inclusivity through intelligent and affordable assistive technology.

💡 Solution Overview

BlindAssist operates as a smart assistive stick that continuously senses the surrounding environment and provides audio-based guidance to the user.

Core Features

Real-Time Obstacle Detection using ultrasonic sensors

Machine Learning–Based Object Recognition via a camera module
